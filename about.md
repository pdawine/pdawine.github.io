Welcome to my pages! I'm Dawine Pierre, or just "Ben" for relatives. I have a diploma in Rural Engineering, a [Specialization in Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/SV2QST3RG45L), a license in Software Engineering and ... - I'm a fan of checkers, web programming, statistics, soccer, and anything for which conception is worthy...

## A little bit about my background

Born in Terrier-rouge, Haiti in 1976 to parents irresponsible, I spent all my childhood years in Cap-Haïtien with my aunt and the bulk of the rest of my professional career in Port-au-Prince.

> Life is thick sown with thorns. there's no other way than to pass quicklty through them, the longer you dwell on your misfortune, the greater is its power to harm you.


## Teaching

I've have been at UNCNH and UPH during one year, teaching the sciences of Climatology and Technical Drawing.

Some of the projects and web-based applications I have published are as follows:

## Working with and setting up start-ups

For over 15 years I've been the GIS & Database Manager at the [American Red Cross](http://www.redcross.org) and [ACTED](http://www.acted.org) and the GIS specialist at DAI. I was involved in projects from their Identification and Design to Evaluation. I had a great enthousiasm in hiring staff, setting up management teams, reporting to financial boards, adjusting conduct policies - it's been an amazingly experience! 

I'm currently involved with an innovative Information System Enterprise [ECSI Geo](https://pdawine.github.io/2019/02/05/coffee-information-system/) that just launched in 2015, I'm the director - so far it's been hard work and great fun.
